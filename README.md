# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

## **Sprint 7 - Vue II**

The second part of my Vue learning journey. This sprint will introduce routing, forms, and using Bootstrap with Vue. The project brief is the following:

> We will develop an application with the aim of facilitating the calculations for the budget of a webpage, adding more interactions with the user compared to the previous practice (checkboxes, inputs, buttons).
>
> The webpage should react and modify the total price based on the options chosen by the user.
